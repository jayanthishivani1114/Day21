    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the dataset contains input-output pairs (labels). \n",
    "The model learns by comparing its predictions to the correct answers and adjusting itself to minimize errors.\n",
    "    It is commonly used for classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numerical values).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning works with data that has no labels or predefined answers.\n",
    "    The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters in the data. \n",
    "    It is commonly used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a learning method where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or\n",
    "penalties based on its actions. The objective is to learn a policy that maximizes long-term rewards.\n",

    "## Why Choosing the Right Type Matters\n",
    "Choosing the wrong learning framework can cause a project to fail before it even begins. \n",
    "    If you try supervised learning without labeled data, your model has nothing to learn from.\n",
    "If you use unsupervised learning when labels exist, you waste valuable information.\n",
    "    Reinforcement learning requires interaction and rewards—without them, it cannot function properly. \n",
    "    Correctly framing the problem is critical to success in Machine Learning."
